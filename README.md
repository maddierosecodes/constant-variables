# Athena Hack 2022 Entry - The Constant Variables

As part of Athena Hack 2022, we were asked to spend 24 hours putting together an app. We chose the theme 'helping refugees or displaced people around the world'. The result is a ridesharing app aimed at refugees and asylum seekers who need reliable transport to attend important appointments, visit places like London to retrieve important work and visa documents, and to foster community amongst volunteers and refugees and asylum seekers.

This app was built with React and Firebase.

To use this repo, clone it and run `npm install` to install the necessary depedencies.
